## Adding WiFi to the ECoS station.

THe ECoS station network interface is Ethernet.

I simply use an Ethernet to WiFi Bridge that I configured for my home WiFi Network. 

This bridge is a [Vonets device](http://www.vonets.com/ProductViews.asp?D_ID=14).

I use the DHCP-server feature in the IP Setup of the ECoS. But before checking the `Get IP settings from DHCP`, it's necessary to enter  the IP address of your router in the `Gateway` Field.

The setup is the following:
