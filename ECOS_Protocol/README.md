## ECoS protocol.

In this project my goal is to control the switching of my turnouts with a Raspberry PI Pico W by sending command to the ECoS station.

The Pico will also be responsible for the management of traffic lights and routes.

The ECoS station has a communication protocol using a TCP connection on the 15471 port on which commands are sent. These commands use a string format.

The protcol definition exists only in [german](protocol_german.pdf). Using an automatic pdf translation tool gives some help to understand the protocol (see [here](protocol_english.pdf)).

The station is accessed by the means of objects linked to a numeric identifier. In our application we will use the object **11** which is the switching item manager.

The message to be sent is the following : `set(11,switch[<n><d>])`

`<n>` is the turnout number, `<d>` is '**g**' (gr√ºn = straight) or '**r**' (rot = deviated)

For instance `set(11,switch[4g])` means set turnout 4 to straight position.

Before writing code in MicroPython on the Pico, I used a tool to send TCP requests from my PC. I used [Packet Sender](https://packetsender.com/) which is very handy.
